# Copywriting and Anti-AI Rules

The rules write-page applies when it writes the actual copy for a `copy` fix:
headlines, subheads, CTAs, section body. The benchmark grounds the structure; these
rules govern the words. When `.agents/webanatomy-context.md` records a Voice and tone
or a Locale, those win over the defaults here.

## Writing style (non-negotiable)

1. **Clear over clever.** If clear and clever conflict, pick clear.
2. **Simple words.** "use" not "utilize", "help" not "facilitate", "show" not "demonstrate".
3. **Specific over vague.** Replace "save time", "streamline", "optimize", "powerful",
   "seamless" with a concrete outcome. "Cut weekly reporting from 4 hours to 15 minutes".
4. **Benefit over feature.** Say what the feature does FOR the buyer, not what it is.
5. **Active voice.** "We generate the report", not "the report is generated".
6. **Confident.** Cut "almost", "very", "really", "basically", "just".
7. **Customer language.** Mirror the words the ICP uses, not internal product names.
8. **One idea per sentence.** Two commas and an "and" means split it or cut it.
9. **Honest.** Never invent a stat, a customer name, or a testimonial. Made-up proof
   is the fastest way to lose trust.

## The 3-4 alternatives rule (for every copy fix)

A `copy` recommendation never ships one version. Give 3-4 alternatives with genuinely
different angles, so the user can pick the one that fits their truth:

- **Outcome-led** — the result the buyer gets. `{Achieve outcome} without {pain}`.
- **Pain-led** — the problem they feel today. `Never {unpleasant event} again` / `Stop {pain}. Start {gain}.`
- **Proof-led** — lead with the number or named proof. `{Metric} {audience} already {result}`.
- **Category-led** — name the category and audience plainly. `The {category} for {audience}`.

Label each angle so the choice is obvious. Do this for the hero H1 and for each
content CTA the fix touches.

## Headline formulas (starting points, not templates to ship verbatim)

- `{Achieve outcome} without {pain point}`
- `Turn {input} into {outcome}`
- `{Achieve outcome} in {timeframe}`
- `Never {unpleasant event} again`
- `{Question that names the main pain}`
- `The {category} for {audience}`

## CTA copy

- Weak (avoid): Submit, Sign Up, Learn More, Click Here, Get Started.
- Strong: `[Action verb] + [what they get]` — "Start my free trial", "Get the checklist",
  "See pricing for my team", "Book a 15-min demo".
- Reduce risk next to the click when you can: "No card required", "2-minute setup".

## Anti-AI tells (delete on sight)

Copy that reads as machine-written kills trust. Cut these:

- **Throat-clearing openers**: "In today's fast-paced world", "It's worth noting that",
  "This is a great opportunity to", "When it comes to", "In order to".
- **Empty intensifiers**: "truly", "incredibly", "seamlessly", "effortlessly", "robust",
  "cutting-edge", "world-class", "best-in-class", "game-changing", "revolutionary".
- **The rule of three tic**: "fast, simple, and powerful" stacked on every line.
- **Hedging**: "may help", "can potentially", "designed to" — say what it does.
- **Restating the obvious**: a subhead that repeats the headline in different words.
- **Em-dashes** for drama, and the "X. Period." construction.
- **"Your X…" framing** for descriptive copy — use "The X…" (house style).
- **Exclamation marks.** Remove them.

If a sentence would survive being said out loud by a real operator to a customer, keep
it. If it sounds like a brochure, cut it.

## Voice, locale, house style

- Write in the Locale from `.agents/webanatomy-context.md` (the copy language, not the
  example pool). Match the Voice and tone when recorded.
- House style always applies: no em-dashes, "The X…" not "Your X…", never expose
  framework internals. The canon is `webanatomy-setup/references/house-style.md`.
